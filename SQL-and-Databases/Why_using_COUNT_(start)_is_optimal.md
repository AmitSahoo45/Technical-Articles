### Debunking the Myth: COUNT(*) in MySQL is Not Slow

Counting rows in a MySQL database is a common operation that developers use frequently. However, there's a persistent myth in the tech community that using `COUNT(*)` is the slowest way to count rows. Let's debunk this myth and understand why `COUNT(*)` is actually optimized for performance.

#### The Myth of COUNT(*)

You might have heard someone cautioning against using `COUNT(*)` with a rationale that it examines all columns in the table, thus slowing down the process. Instead, they might suggest using `COUNT(ID)` or a specific column to speed things up. But, this is a misunderstanding of how MySQL optimizes count operations.

#### The Reality of COUNT(*)

In MySQL, `COUNT(*)` is specifically optimized to be the fastest way to count rows. The asterisk (*) in `COUNT(*)` does not mean "all columns" as it does in `SELECT *`. Instead, it instructs MySQL to count rows in the most efficient way possible.

#### How MySQL Optimizes COUNT(*)

When you execute `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM table_name`, MySQL uses the most efficient method to count rows, often leveraging the smallest secondary non-null index. This is a compact representation of data on the disk, which speeds up the counting process significantly.

For example, consider a table `todos` with indexes on `ID`, `due_date`, and `created_at`. When counting rows, MySQL might choose to use the `due_date` index because it's a secondary index that is compact and efficient to traverse. This choice is made regardless of whether you use `COUNT(*)` or `COUNT(ID)`.

#### Proof with EXPLAIN

To illustrate, using the `EXPLAIN` command on `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM todos`, you might see that MySQL decides to use the `due_date` index. Changing the query to `SELECT COUNT(ID) FROM todos` does not alter this behavior because MySQL optimizes for row counting by selecting the most efficient index.
